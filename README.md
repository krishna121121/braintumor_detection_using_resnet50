Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning
A deep learning model for the classification of brain MRI scans. This project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning in medical imaging by accurately classifying MRI scans as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free.

üßê Overview
The early detection of brain tumors is a critical step in effective medical treatment. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform binary classification on a dataset of brain MRI images. The model is trained to distinguish between tumorous and non-tumorous scans with high accuracy. This project can serve as a foundational tool to assist healthcare professionals in the initial screening process.

üöÄ Features
Image Classification: Accurately classifies brain MRI images.

High Performance: Achieves high accuracy, precision, and recall on the test dataset.

Robust Model: The model is trained using data augmentation techniques to improve its generalization.

Simple Interface: Includes scripts for training the model and making predictions on new images.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Language: Python

Frameworks:

TensorFlow

Keras

Libraries:

Numpy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

OpenCV (cv2) or PIL

üìÇ Dataset
The model was trained on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains a collection of brain MRI images split into two folders:

yes: Images with a brain tumor.

no: Images with no brain tumor.

You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-tumor-mri-dataset.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:

Bash

venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
üíª Usage
Training the Model
To train the model from scratch, run the train.py script. The trained model will be saved as a .h5 file.

Bash

python train.py
Making Predictions
To classify a new brain MRI image, use the predict.py script and provide the path to your image.

Bash

python predict.py --image_path "path/to/your/image.jpg"
Example:

Bash

python predict.py --image_path "data/test/yes/Y1.jpg"
The output will be the predicted class (Tumor or No Tumor) and the confidence score.

üìà Results
The trained CNN model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

Accuracy: 98.0%

Precision: 97.5%

Recall: 98.5%

F1-Score: 98.0%

üõ£Ô∏è Future Work
Explore advanced architectures like Vision Transformers (ViTs) to potentially improve accuracy.

Implement a multi-class classification to differentiate between various types of brain tumors.

Develop a user-friendly web application to make the model accessible to a wider audience.
